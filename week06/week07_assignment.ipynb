In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

To me the easiest part in this assignment preparing the JSON data since I had little bit knowledge about this JSON data structure. It is challenging to select specific parts and nested data was correctly fetching. This is the best way to represent and retrieving the data, the creative process of creating my own data which gave a unique part to the assignment, and I felt more engaging to create my own data, even though the process was little time taking as I need to check the code and JSON data was accurate. All in all, this exercise improved my comprehension of JSON and gave me useful opportunities to use my Python skills."
